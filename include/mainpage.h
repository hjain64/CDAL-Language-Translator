\section intro_sec Introduction

This is the Introduction to FACL project. Here we have designed a Language translator that will convert a DSL (Data Specificified Language) (Fcal) to C++ program.
we have started from the basic structure by implementing our own scanner, parser and build abstract synatx tree that will check
our grammer and syntactical error that will occur during Parsing.

This project is divided into 3 iterations.
- The 1st iteration requires us to create a scanner to scan a sequence of text and convert it into a Token linkedlist
- The 2nd iteration requires us to link both parser and scanner together
- The 3rd iteration reuqires us to create abstract syntax tree, by creating concrete and abstract class for each productions.
